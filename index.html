        <h1>Team Fortress 2 FastDL For Kasuxae's Random Shenanigans Server</h1>
    </header>

    <p>My TF2 Server file downloads using a github respository as a "FASTDL" "server".</p>
        
        <h2>Why Did I Do It Like This</h2>
        
        <p>This little project started as a search for a way to get my own TF2 server hosted on my machine for me and my friends without having to worry about paying a service to host one for me.</p>

        <p>It then turned into a rabbit hole of trying to find the easiest and most cost effective way for me to have custom maps and such get sent to clients that join without having to pay a webserver to host the files.</p>
        
        <h3>Notes And Thoughts</h3>
        
        <p>If I suddenly had a penny every time I had run into poor people problems, I would be set for life.</p>
        
        <p>Having to scour the internet in search of information on the most cost effective way to do somthing is hard considering almost everyone wants to get richer.</p>
        
        <p>I just do my own thing with little regard of the consequences when I feel like I can get away with it.</p>
        
        <p>Honestly I am unsure if this is even allowed on githib because I can not find a concrete answer either in the terms of service or online, However if somehow this IS allowed on github, then GREAT!</p>
        
        <h2>How To Do It</h2>
        
        <p>I simply followed <a class="site" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcismZ0uZ1A">the guide</a> by the lovely "Sour Dani" on youtube, However I may add a refined text based guide here if I somehow got requested to do so by enough people.</p>
        
        <h2>Finding My Server</h2>
        
        <p>My server uses the -fakeip startup command as a security measure as well as a greifing deterrent, that means that you cannot favorite the server.</p>
        
        <p>There is a way to fix/stop -fakeip from preventing favoriting a server, But at the moment of writing this, I do not feel like going that far for my own server.</p>
        
        <p>To find my server(or any other server that uses this method), you may either need to install a clientside mod to allow you to search/favorite for server's by name, or know at least one of the server's unique tags and enter said tag into the tag search bar.</p>
        
        <p>My server is nammed "Kasuxae's Random Shenanigans Server" and the most unique tag on the server is "advancedbots".</p>

            <li>FOR THE CURIOUS: This site is a placeholder due to the nature of the way I am setting up "fastdl". I did not need to do all of this.</li>
