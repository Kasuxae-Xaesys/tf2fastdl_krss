# Team Fortress 2 FastDL For Kasuxae's Random Shenanigans Server
My TF2 Server file downloads using a github respository as a base to download from.

# Why Did I Do It Like This?
This little project started as a way to get my own TF2 server hosted on my own machine for me and my friends without having to worry about paying a service to host one for me.
Then it turned into a rabbit hole of trying to find the easiest and most cost effective way for me to have custom maps and such to get sent to clients that join without having to pay a webserver to host the files.

# Final Notes And Thoughts
If I suddenly had a penny every time I had run into poor people problems, I would be set for life.
Having to scour the internet in search of information on the most cost effective way to do somthing is hard considering almost everyone wants to get richer.
So I just do my own thing with little regard of the consequences when i feel like i can get away with it.
Honestly I am unsure if this is even allowed on githib because I can not find a concrete answer either in the terms of service or online, However if somehow this IS allowed on github, then GREAT!
